<p>Image uploading is the one thing you must remember.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your website is not configured to upload images to the server
automatically.&nbsp; This means that your images will have to be already on the
internet if you are copying and pasting from a Word or other file on your
computer.&nbsp; Images can easily be copy and pasted if you see them on the
internet anywhere already..<br>

<br>

<font size="1">

i.e. select an image you see on our main page and right click and copy it.&nbsp;
Then you can paste into your input area to submit your materials.</font>
